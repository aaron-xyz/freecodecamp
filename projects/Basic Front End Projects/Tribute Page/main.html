		<div id="introduction">
			<p>
				Richard Feynman was one of the most extraordinary scientist of the 20th century. As a brilliant physicist, he pioneered an
				entirely new area of his subject. He discovered a new law of nature, the most numerically precise physical theory ever
				invented. Yet, he scorned the Nobel Prize he received for his work.
			</p>
			<p>
				Feynman's brilliance helped shape history. As a young man, he helped to build the atom bomb. And yet throughout his life,
				Feynman rejected authority and refuse to conform, preferring instead to follow his passions, from bongo playing to biology,
				from poetry to painting, from computing to cracking safes, Feynman fascinations with the world knew no bounds.
			</p>
			<p>
				In his dying days as a maverick investigator on the Challenger shuttle disaster, he confronted the Washington stablishment
				to reveal the truth about what went wrong. Above all, Feynman infectius enthusiasm for life captivated millions of readers
				and viewers. One of the most captivating communicator in the history of science.
